# Gender-Based Violence Lexicon Ontology

Welcome to the **Gender-Based Violence Lexicon Ontology** repository! This ontology provides a structured and comprehensive framework for understanding and analyzing terms, concepts, and legal frameworks related to gender-based violence (GBV). It is designed to support researchers, policymakers, activists, and developers in building knowledge graphs, applications, and tools to address GBV.

The preferred prefix for this ontology is **ogbv: www.gbvbase.com**

## Overview

This ontology captures:
- **GBV-related terms** (e.g., "malaya", "prostitute" "slut-shaming") and their meanings.
- **Forms of violence** (e.g., psychological, verbal, physical).
- **Implications** of GBV (e.g., emotional trauma, social stigma).
- **Targeted gender(s)** (e.g., women, men).
- **Geographical context** (e.g., countries, regions, continents).
- **Legal frameworks and policies** addressing GBV (e.g., laws, enforcement agencies, effectiveness ratings).

The ontology is built using **OWL (Web Ontology Language)** and is designed to be extensible, modular, and interoperable with other knowledge graphs and semantic web tools.

    }
    ```

2. **List all legal frameworks in Africa with their effectiveness ratings:**
    ```sparql
    SELECT ?framework ?rating
    WHERE {
         ?framework a :LegalFramework ;
                        :hasEffectivenessRating ?rating ;
                        :hasLegalFramework ?country .
         ?country :locatedInContinent :Africa .
